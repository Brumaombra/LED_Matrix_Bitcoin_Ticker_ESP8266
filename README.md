LED Matrix Bitcoin Ticker with ESP8266

A very simple ticker showing the Bitcoin price and various price metrics.
This project uses the MAX72** matrix for displaying the data, and the ESP8266 for retrieving and printing the data.

To make it run, simply change the values of the variables highlighted by the message "TODO - Change with your data"
